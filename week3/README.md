# Pine City Zoo â€” Week 3

This is the Pine City Zoo demo app for Week 3 of the FNB App Academy.

## Setup (step-by-step)

1. Create a folder named `Pine-City-Zoo` in `Documents/Websites` (or where you keep projects).
2. Copy these files into that folder: `index.html`, `animals.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, the `animals/` folder and `images/` folder.
3. Put all images into `images/` using the filenames in the project tree. If you don't have images, download free photos from Unsplash/Pexels and rename them.
4. Run locally: open a terminal in the project folder and run a simple server:

   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   # then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
